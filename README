This was made over too much time while trying to determine an optimal party configuration to play Temple of Elemental Evil.

In the game, you start by creating a party of five characters. It follows, roughly D&D 3.0 rules. As a longtime DM, I have a
host of characters that I've written over the years, but I had never put them together into a party that would also feel
'balanced' for video game purposes. Some of the characters I subjectively like more than others, but it was also important
to actually have a good balance of classes and some diversity.

Then, this reads a CSV, tries every combination of the characters, and chooses the K highest scoring ones. At first, I
thought to just do the five for loops version, but I was too embarassed with myself so ended up writing the general
case


Usage:
See char_data.csv for example data (with a header)

Only positional command line arguments, sorry :)
python analyze_char_combos.py $filename [$num_combinations_to_print] [$party_size] [$use_header]
